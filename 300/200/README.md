# 200 - Setting up the Database and Model

In this step, you’ll set up your database connection, and create an SQLAlchemy *database model*, which is a Python class that represents the table that stores your data. You’ll initiate the database, create a table for students based on the model you’ll declare, and add a few students into your students table.
