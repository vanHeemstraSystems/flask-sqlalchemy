# 100 - Introduction

In web applications, you usually need a database, which is an organized collection of data. You use a database to store and maintain persistent data that can be retrieved and manipulated efficiently. For example, in a social media application, you have a database where user data (personal information, posts, comments, followers) is stored in a way that can be efficiently manipulated. You can add data to a database, retrieve it, modify it, or delete it, depending on different requirements and conditions. In a web application, these requirements might be a user adding a new post, deleting a post, or deleting their account, which may or may not delete their posts. The actions you perform to manipulate data will depend on specific features in your application. For example, you might not want users to add posts with no titles.

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications in the Python Language. [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is an SQL toolkit that provides efficient and high-performing database access for relational databases. It provides ways to interact with several database engines such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It gives you access to the database’s SQL functionalities. It also gives you an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), which allows you to make queries and handle data using simple Python objects and methods. [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/) is a Flask extension that makes using SQLAlchemy with Flask easier, providing you tools and methods to interact with your database in your Flask applications through SQLAlchemy.

In this tutorial, you’ll build a small student management system that demonstrates how to use the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. You’ll use it with Flask to perform basic tasks, such as connecting to a database server, creating a table, adding data to your table, retrieving it, and updating and deleting items from your database. You’ll use SQLAlchemy with [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html), although you can use it with other database engines too, such as PostgreSQL and MySQL. SQLite works well with Python because the Python standard library provides the [```sqlite3``` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html), which is used by SQLAlchemy behind the scenes to interact with SQLite databases without having to install anything. SQlite is installed on Linux systems by default, and is installed as part of the Python package on Windows.
